222,elasticsearch-7.12.0,   Stop blocking snapshot deletes due to concurrency limits , Bug fixes,,,,https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/71050),,
223,elasticsearch-7.11.2,   A document disclosure flaw was found in the Elasticsearch suggester and profile API when Document and Field Level Security are enabled. The suggester and profile API are normally disabled for an index when document level security is enabled on the index. Certain queries are able to enable the profiler and suggester which could lead to disclosing the existence of documents and fields the attacker should not be able to view. All versions of Elasticsearch before 6.8.15 and 7.11.2 are affected by this flaw. You must upgrade to 6.8.15 or 7.11.2 to obtain the fix. [CVE-2021-22137], Security,,,,,,
224,elasticsearch-7.11.2,"   If autoscaling is enabled for machine learning, the administrator of the cluster should increase the cluster setting `xpack.ml.max_open_jobs`. This allows autoscaling to run reliably as it relies on assigning jobs only via memory. Having `xpack.ml.max_open_jobs` as a small number may cause autoscaling to behave unexpectedly. ", Known issues,,,,,,
225,elasticsearch-7.11.2,"   If autoscaling is enabled and job assignment takes an inordinate amount of time, scaling sizes may increase much higher than required. Elasticsearch 7.13.0 contains a fix for this. For more details, see ", Known issues,,https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/72509),,,,
226,elasticsearch-7.11.2,"   Snapshot and restore: If an index is deleted while the cluster is concurrently taking more than one snapshot then there is a risk that one of the snapshots may never complete and also that some shard data may be lost from the repository, causing future restore operations to fail. To mitigate this problem, prevent concurrent snapshot operations by setting `snapshot.max_concurrent_operations: 1`.", Known issues,,,,,,

If you have configured an Active Directory or LDAP realm, then Elasticseach will fail to start with an error message indicating that `Could not initialize class com.unboundid.util.Debug`. This exception is fatal. If you encounter this during an upgrade, because Elasticsearch failed during node construction, you can safely downgrade to your previous version of Elasticsearch.
